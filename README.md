##My Homepage##

(I have purchased the domain name "www.pdrumm.info", but Firebase is currently experiencing
difficulties for me. I get an error saying "Sorry, we had a problem with your request.")

My homepage is my assignment for homework 3 in web-applications. This website uses my-homepage that
I created in homework 3. The task for this assignment was to convert all pixel measurements to
percentages (to make it flexible for most monitor sizes) and to make the page mobile friendly as
well. Included in this web application are the html files:

- Index
- Contact
- Resume
- Mediagallery
